# SQL Aggregations

## IS NULL / IS NOT NULL
NULL is a property of data, not value


## COUNT the Number of Rows in a Table

	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM accounts;
	------
	SELECT COUNT(accounts.id)
	FROM accounts;

## SUM
SUM will ignore NULL values

## MIN and MAX

## AVG

##MEDIAN

## GROUP BY to aggregate data within subsets of the data. For example, grouping for different accounts, different regions, or different sales representatives.

	SELECT w.channel, s.name, COUNT(channel) occ
	FROM sales_reps s
	JOIN accounts a
	ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
	JOIN web_events w
	ON w.account_id = a.id
	GROUP BY w.channel, s.name
	ORDER BY occ DESC

##DISTINCT returns the distinct rows

##HAVING
WHERE cannot be used in aggregating results, need HAVING 

	HAVING SUM(...) >= 20555
	
##DATE
DATE_TRUNC allows you to truncate your date to a particular part of your date-time column. Common trunctions are day, month, and year. Here is a great blog post by Mode Analytics on the power of this function.

DATE_PART can be useful for pulling a specific portion of a date, but notice pulling month or day of the week (dow) means that you are no longer keeping the years in order. Rather you are grouping for certain components regardless of which year they belonged in.

### Questions: CASE
Use the SQL environment below to assist with answering the following questions. Whether you get stuck or you just want to double check your solutions, my answers can be found at the top of the next concept.

1. Write a query to display for each order, the account ID, total amount of the order, and the level of the order - ‘Large’ or ’Small’ - depending on if the order is $3000 or more, or smaller than $3000.
		
		SELECT a.id, o.total_amt_usd, 
		CASE WHEN o.total_amt_usd <=3000 THEN 'small' ELSE 'large' END orderType
		FROM accounts a
		JOIN orders o
		ON o.account_id = a.id;
		
2. Write a query to display the number of orders in each of three categories, based on the total number of items in each order. The three categories are: 'At Least 2000', 'Between 1000 and 2000' and 'Less than 1000'.
	
		SELECT COUNT(*) numOrder, 
		CASE 
			WHEN total >= 2000 THEN 'At Least 2000' 
			WHEN total BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000 THEN 'Between 1000 and 2000'
			ELSE 'Less than 1000'
			END AS catogories
		FROM orders
		GROUP BY catogories;

3. We would like to understand 3 different levels of customers based on the amount associated with their purchases. The top level includes anyone with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 usd. The second level is between 200,000 and 100,000 usd. The lowest level is anyone under 100,000 usd. Provide a table that includes the level associated with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales of all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

		SELECT a.name aname, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) AS totalSale,
			CASE 
				WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top level'
				WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) BETWEEN 100000 AND 200000 THEN 'second level'
				ELSE 'lowest level'
			END AS level
		FROM accounts a
		JOIN orders o
		ON o.account_id = a.id
		GROUP BY aname
		ORDER BY totalSale DESC;


4. We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, but we want to obtain the total amount spent by customers only in 2016 and 2017. Keep the same levels as in the previous question. Order with the top spending customers listed first.

		SELECT a.name aname, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) AS totalSale,
			CASE 
				WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'top level'
				WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) BETWEEN 100000 AND 200000 THEN 'second level'
				ELSE 'lowest level'
			END AS level
		FROM accounts a
		JOIN orders o
		ON o.account_id = a.id
		WHERE o.occurred_at BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2018-01-01'
		GROUP BY aname
		ORDER BY totalSale DESC;

5. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, and a column with top or not depending on if they have more than 200 orders. Place the top sales people first in your final table.

		SELECT COUNT(o.*) numOrder, s.name sname,
		CASE 
			WHEN COUNT(o.*) > 200 THEN 'top' ELSE 'not' END top
		FROM accounts a
		JOIN orders o
		ON o.account_id = a.id
		JOIN sales_reps s
		ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
		GROUP BY sname
		ORDER BY numOrder DESC;

6. The previous didn't account for the middle, nor the dollar amount associated with the sales. Management decides they want to see these characteristics represented as well. We would like to identify top performing sales reps, which are sales reps associated with more than 200 orders or more than 750000 in total sales. The middle group has any rep with more than 150 orders or 500000 in sales. Create a table with the sales rep name, the total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a column with top, middle, or low depending on this criteria. Place the top sales people based on dollar amount of sales first in your final table. You might see a few upset sales people by this criteria!

		SELECT COUNT(o.*) numOrder, s.name sname, SUM(total_amt_usd),
		CASE 
			WHEN COUNT(o.*) > 200 OR SUM(total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'top' 
			WHEN COUNT(o.*) > 150 OR SUM(total_amt_usd) > 500000 THEN 'middle' 
			ELSE 'not' END top
		FROM accounts a
		JOIN orders o
		ON o.account_id = a.id
		JOIN sales_reps s
		ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
		GROUP BY sname
		ORDER BY 3 DESC;
